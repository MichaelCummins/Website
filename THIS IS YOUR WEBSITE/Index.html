                                I graduated from Marist College in May of 2019 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, as well as minors in Information Technology, Information Systems, and Cybersecurity. Currently, my main goal is to find an entry-level software development position that will allow me to utilize and build upon my current software knowledge.

                                    I am currently working on learning Unity by creating a top-down 2D rogue-like game that procedurally generates levels so the player has a very different experience each time they hit play. I am using this as an opportunity to better myself as a software and game developer by combining learning C# scripting with game dev best practices.
